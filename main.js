Instructions: 

Create a small app to track books you’ve read or want to read (If you are not in to books, feel free to change it to movies). Use prompt and alert to simulate the menu. 

You will: 

Use objects to represent books 

Store multiple books in an array 

Write functions to add, list and update books 

Requirements: 

A library array to store all book objects 

Each book should have: 

Title 

Author 

isRead 

Implement these functions: 

addBook() – asks for details and adds a new book object to the library 

listBooks() – display a list of all books (console.log works fine here) 

markAsRead(title) – finds a book by title and sets isRead to true 

 

I have created some starting code for you here: 

En bild som visar text, skärmbild

AI-genererat innehåll kan vara felaktigt., Picture 

 

Bonus challenge (optional): 

Allow the user to remove a book 

Allow the user to list only unread books 

 

These methods could be useful in this assigment so you’ll have to do some research on your own: 

push( ) 

forEach( ) 

find( ) 

filter( )
